Main Project Goals:
	* 1) Pack ISO fields with basic data
	2) Create entire ISO messages
	3) Get a memory dump of all ISO data
		Create a nice interface (give filenames, and perms),
		using fwrite and standard C.

Extra Helpful Includes
	1) Little Endian Flag & Big Endian Flag - memory dumps
	2) Create memory dumps easily

Long Term Thoughts:
	Write the project's own allocator for use instead of the system malloc.
		Speed?
